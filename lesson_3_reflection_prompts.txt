1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To share my work with, and collaborate with others.


2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

The commits may not be ready to be shared publicly. If Git updates the remote automatically, half-baked code might be shared with the public.
